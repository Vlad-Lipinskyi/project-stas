        <strong>About:</strong>
        Counter-Strike 2 is the next evolution of the legendary CS:GO, rebuilt
        with the new Source 2 engine. It features improved graphics, realistic
        smoke behavior, better audio, and updated maps. The core gameplay stays
        true to its competitive roots, but with technical enhancements for a
        modern experience.

        <strong>Fun Facts:</strong> 1. Smoke grenades now react to bullets and
        explosions. 2. Matchmaking uses a new rating system called “Premier
        Mode.” 3. CS2 replaces CS:GO — it's not a separate game.
